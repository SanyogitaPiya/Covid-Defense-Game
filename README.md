The project is a 2D game for android platforms to bring awareness to children about COVID-19.
Our game is called COVID Defense, and the premise of the game is for the player to utilize available defense options and place them down 
to defend against waves of COVID invaders that become more intense as the rounds progress. The next section will further discuss the gameâ€™s 
mechanics. There will also be backend features that deal with user authentication and facilitate leaderboards. The creation of this project 
will rely on the use of Unity and Firebase for the backend.

### Users have access to user authentication.
