# C19Defense

The project that our group has agreed to do is a 2D game for android platforms to bring awareness to children about COVID-19.
Our game is called COVID Defense, and the premise of the game is for the player to utilize available defense options and place them down 
to defend against waves of COVID invaders that become more intense as the rounds progress. The next section will further discuss the gameâ€™s 
mechanics. There will also be backend features that deal with user authentication and facilitate leaderboards. The creation of this project 
will rely on the use of Unity and Firebase for the backend.

## Users have access to user authentication. 

## Users have access to the view menu. 

## Users should be able to spawn into a default map.  

## Users have access to defense structures. 

## Users must defend against COVID enemy units. 

## Users should be able to progress to the next level upon completion of the prior level. 

## Users have the liberty to place the tower as their wish at the start of the game. 
 
## A leaderboard is displayed at the end of the game.
